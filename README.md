This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Docker images: a missing or inaccessible requirements file. The initial Dockerfile attempts to install dependencies specified in requirements.txt, but this file may be missing from the context or inaccessible due to permission issues. The solution shows how to resolve the issue by ensuring the requirements file is included and accessible during the build process.
